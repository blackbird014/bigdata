# bigdata
This is a quick way of sharing code which can be useful on bigdata.
The files are not organized.
The main idea is to have quasi gists, easy to use in the virtual environment. A next step which is reccomandable is to setup a local development environment. The phase 1, less ambitious, is to run the code in the cludera VM using, for example, Jupyter to execute python code in spark. Whoever is following the big data spec from coursera will recognize some exercises assigned there.
Any pull request to improve the code or to show different approaches is welcome
